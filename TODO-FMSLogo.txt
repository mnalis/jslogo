To Do
-----
- Document noticed deviations from FMS Logo:
	- "arc" starts from different angle
	- "circle" missing
	- "setfc" (flood color for fill) missing
	- "fill" uses "setpc" color instead of (missing) "setfc"
	- "setpc" and "setsc" - color in list format has R/G/B values 0-99 (and FMSLogo has HTML-alike 0-255)
	
- Update docs in language.html for missing/modified commands

- Implement and modify commands so they work like in FMS Logo
	- current workaround is Logo initialization block which must be
	  executed from "Examples"; reimplement in pure JavaScript
